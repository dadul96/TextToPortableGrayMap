# TextToPortableGrayMap
Converts a text file into a Portable GrayMap (.pgm) picture. The resulting picture can be converted back using the code from my [PortableGrayMapToText](https://github.com/dadul96/PortableGrayMapToText)-repo.

### Installation
There is no installation required. Just download the exe-file (`TextToPortableGrayMap.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/dadul96/TextToPortableGrayMap/releases)) or compile it yourself.

### How to use
* Copy a text-file with the name `input.txt` into the same folder as the exe-file and run it.
* The output image will be called `output.pgm` and stored in the same folder.

### Example
The example files can be found in the `example`-folder.
#### Screenshot of the input-textfile:
![](/example/screenshots/input_screenshot.png)
#### Screenshot of the output-picture:

### Built With
